Your open-source robotic mobile manipulation stack!

HomeRobot lets you get started running a range of robotics tasks on a low-cost mobile manipulator, starting with _Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation_, or OVMM. OVMM is a challenging task which means that, in an unknown environment, a robot must:
  - Explore its environment
  - Find an object
  - Find a receptacle -- a location on which it must place this object
  - Put the object down on the receptacle.

## Core Concepts

This package assumes you have a low-cost mobile robot with limited compute -- initially a [Hello Robot Stretch](hello-robot.com/) -- and a "workstation" with more GPU compute. Both are assumed to be running on the same network.

This is the recommended workflow for hardware robots:
  - Turn on your robot; for the Stretch, run `stretch_robot_home.py` to get it ready to use.
  - From your workstation, SSH into the robot and start a [ROS launch file](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) which brings up necessary low-level control and hardware drivers.
  - If desired, run [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) on the workstation to see what the robot is seeing.
  - Start running your AI code on the workstation - For example, you can run `python projects/stretch_grasping/eval_episode.py` to run the OVMM task.

We provide a couple connections for useful perception libraries like [Detic](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic) and [Contact Graspnet](https://github.com/NVlabs/contact_graspnet), which you can then use as a part of your methods.

There are two core classes in HomeRobot that you need to be concerned with:
  - *Environments* extend the [abstract Environment class](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/core/abstract_env.py) and provide *observations* of the world, and a way to *apply actions*.
  - *Agents* extend the [abstract Agent class](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/core/abstract_agent.py), which takes in an [observation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/core/interfaces.py#L95) and produces an [action](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/core/interfaces.py#L50).

### Organization

[HomeRobot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/) is broken up into three different packages:

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [home_robot](src/home_robot) | Core package |
| [home_robot_sim](src/home_robot_sim) | Simulation |
| [home_robot_hw](src/home_robot_hw) | ROS package containing hardware drivers for the Hello Stretch Robot |

The [home_robot](src/home_robot) package contains embodiment-agnostic agent code, such as our [ObjectNav agent](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/agent/objectnav_agent/objectnav_agent.py) (finds objects in scenes) and our [hierarchical OVMM agent](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/agent/ovmm_agent/ovmm_agent.py). YThese agents can be extended or modified to implement your own solution.

Importantly, agents use a fixed set of [interfaces](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot/blob/main/src/home_robot/home_robot/core/interfaces.py)

The [home_robot_sim](src/home_robot_sim) package contains code for interface

## Installation

To set up the hardware stack with a Hello Stretch Robot, see instructions in `home_robot_hw`.

To set up the simulation stack with Habitat, see instructions in `home_robot_sim`.

For the OVMM challenge, see [here](projects/stretch_ovmm/README.md).


## Code Contribution

We use linters for enforcing good code style. The `lint` test will not pass if your code does not conform.

Install the git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks by running
```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
cd $HOME_ROBOT_ROOT
pre-commit install
```

To format manually, run: `pre-commit run --show-diff-on-failure --all-files`
